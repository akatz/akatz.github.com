Getting my blog off the ground has taken me way too long. I have owned the domain for over 2 years but have just put it off for far too long.
Expect me to write about all things Ruby, Rails, Javascript, and DevOps related.

I don't know how often I will be able to write posts, but I feel like if I don't make a commitment to something I won't have any impetus to write.
With this in mind I will endeaveor in the beginning to write 2 a month. And if it's something I continue to feel passionate about maybe increase from
that point on.
